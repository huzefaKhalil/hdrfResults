      p("Wei et al. 2007 involved the constitutive transgenic overexpression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the forebrain of mice. The reasoning behind the location-specific GR overexpression in the forebrain was to increase sensitivity in frontal brain regions to glucocorticoids such as corticosterone, which are released from the adrenal cortex in response to stress, without changing the sensitivity to GR in other parts of the brain and body important for the negative feedback that regulates glucocorticoid release.  To produce this transgenic, they used PCR to introduce codons for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope to the 5’ end of the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) for GR. This HA-GR cDNA was under the control of the forebrain-specific promoter (CaMKIIa), so the HA-GR protein was specifically expressed in the forebrain. Properties of HA-GR, including fidelity and transactivation, were confirmed. The experimental groups tested in this study were hemizygote, GRov male mice (n=6), bred via breeding founders and progeny to C57BL/6J mice, as well as Wild Type (WT) male mice (n=6). All mice were exposed to light between 5:00 am to 7:00 pm on a 14/10 light/dark cycle and housed individually for one week preceding each study. To collect tissue for the microarray experiment, decapitation occurred in the morning at the age of 3-4 months, after one week of single housing. The tissue collection process included rapid dissection of the whole hippocampus, which was stored at -80℃ prior to processing, and the collection of blood samples. Twenty seconds following decapitation, blood samples were promptly placed in iced Eppendorf tubes with EDTA. Microarray analysis was executed using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430_2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California) for transcriptional profiling, and the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and Quant-It PicoGreen dsDNA kit (Invitrogen) for qRT-PCR.

      p("Wei et al, 2012 involved the inducible transgenic overexpression of the glucocorticoid receptor in the forebrain of mice. The reasoning behind the location-specific GR overexpression in the forebrain was to increase sensitivity in frontal brain regions to glucocorticoids such as corticosterone, which are released from the adrenal cortex in response to stress, without changing the sensitivity to GR in other parts of the brain and body important for the negative feedback that regulates glucocorticoid release.  The purpose of implementing the inducibility of this transgenic was to examine the effect of glucocorticoid sensitivity in frontal brain regions at specific developmental stages. Wei et al. generated this inducible GR overexpression in the forebrain by cloning HA-GR cDNA into the response plasmid tetracycline-response element (TRE) of the Tet-Off regulation system. The original HA-GR-TRE mice were then bred with CaMKII-tTA mice, causing tTA expression to target nervous tissue in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, due to the forebrain-specific promoter CaMKIIa controlling HA-GR cDNA expression. These bigenic, male mice were treated with Dox (200 mg/kg chow) to suppress overexpression of GR, and treatment was withdrawn during certain critical periods to allow for GR overexpression to occur. These groups consisted of lifetime expression of GRov (LT.GRov) (no Dox treatment), early life GRov (EL.GRov) (no Dox during postnatal weeks 1-3, but treated thereafter), and no GR overexpression (lifetime Dox treatment). The final group served as the experimental control due to lower levels of locomotor activity found from the CaMKII-tTA mice. For the microarray study, animals without experimental manipulation were used. These adult male mouse brains were collected in the morning with undisturbed conditions, then frozen, and later sliced. This tissue was cryostat-sectioned in the coronal plane at 12 µm. Using an AutoPix instrument, laser capture microdissection was used to obtain two brain regions: the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The transcriptional profiling platform was the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430_2.0 GeneChips. Microarray sample sizes were n=6 per group in the DG study and n=6-7 per group in the NAcc study (Lifetime GRov, n=7; early life GRov mice, n=6; no-GRov control mice, n=6).")

The animals studied were adult male FSL and FRL rats in standard housing in groups of four of the same genotype. Temperature and humidity were held at a constant 22 ±1° C, and rats were kept on a 12-hr light/dark cycle. The goal of this study was to identify genes that fall into three categories: predisposition to depression, response to acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC), or resistance to a low dose of LAC in Flinders Sensitive Line rats (FSL) following acute stress from treatment. The LAC molecule has been shown to have antidepressant effects in FSL rats by establishing a normal energy homeostasis via regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and realignment of glutamate imbalance in the hippocampus. The adult male FSL and FRL rats were administered either a dosage of LAC (sigma, concentration of 0.3% wt/vol) or tap water (vehicle) via the rat sipping bottles, which was available for seven days. During the last two days of treatment, the animals underwent behavioral testing, including an Open Field test on the sixth day, as well as a five-minute forced swim test (FST) on the seventh. Based on immobility times to the FST, FSL rats treated with LAC were divided into two groups: response (rFSL) and no response (nrFSL). The former group was categorized by an immobility time within 1 standard deviation of the mean of the control veh-FRL group. FSL rats with times that did not make this cutoff were placed in the nrFSL group. Directly after the FST, the animals were sacrificed by decapitation with brief exposure to a CO2 saturated chamber just prior. The vDG tissue was dissected and weighed, first by slicing using the brain matrix, and then by punch with 130 mg lysed, and the tissue was then homogenized. Extraction of the RNA was completed using the Qiazol reagent and RNeasy mini (Qiagen). The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used to assess RNA integrity, and the Illumina HiSeq2500 was used for sequencing.

This breeding strategy utilized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats from the same colony yet bred six months apart, with cohort one including 12 FRL and 9 FSL animals, and cohort two including 10 FRL and 8 FSL animals, all of which lived under standard housing conditions. One week before microarray analysis, animals independently underwent the forced swim test.

This served as the control group (n=15).

The animals were kept on a 12:12 light/dark cycle in groups of five per cage, and drug delivery occurred through drinking water in opaque bottles. Serum levels of a separate cohort of animals treated for 21 days with fluoxetine were tested to check for a comparable amount of norfluoxetine (a metabolite of fluoxetine) across all mice. The animals tested in the microarray study also underwent behavioral testing following the drug treatment, in the form of the Novelty Suppressed Feeding Test (NSF) and Forced Swim Test (FST) four days apart, respectively. The NSF test measures determined grouping of animals into “responders” or “resistant” categories. Only the eleven out of the fifteen mice treated with FLX that showed both decreased anxiety on the NSF and decreased behavioral despair on the FST were evaluated using microarray, and eight out of the fifteen control mice were randomly selected for comparison. A week following behavioral testing, while being maintained on drug treatments, the mice were sacrificed. The brains were collected whole and kept in chilled artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for five minutes, and then the hippocampus was removed and sliced transversely along the septotemporal axis.

This study used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model to generate transcriptional profiles using RNA sequencing of control (no stress), susceptible, and resilient mice at three points in time following the CSDS paradigm. The mice in this experiment were male, 6-8 week-old C57BL/6J mice housed five per cage (excluding during social defeat in which they were housed alone) on a 12:12h light-dark cycle, with lights on at 7 am. The chronic stress paradigm was created by subjecting the treatment group to daily, five-minute intervals of social defeat for ten days. The mice at eight weeks of age were paired with an aggressor mouse at six months old. This was followed by housing the victim beside the aggressor, separated only by plexiglass, for the continuation of that day. The purpose of this housing situation was to continue one form of sensory stimulation leading to stress. Control mice were rotated daily among housing across plexiglass barriers with another control mouse as well.  The mice were then divided into the stress susceptible or resilient groups based on their inclination to social interaction with a novel mouse following the ten social defeat experiences. In a two-stage social interaction test, the resilient group was defined as animals that maintained an interest in social interaction with a novel mouse, while the susceptible group avoided social interaction. Following the CSDS paradigm, the animals were sacrificed at varying times including both early, late, and late + stress-primed times to provide insight into the dynamics of these two phenotypes, susceptible or resilient, over time. The early group was sacrificed directly from their cage 48 hours post-defeat, the late group sacrificed 28 days subsequently, and the final group sacrificed 28 days and 1-hour post-defeat, following an additional five-minute re-exposure to an aggressor mouse.

Bagot et. al used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model with C57BL/6J male 8-week old mice by exposure to 10 daily, 5-min defeat sessions by a novel aggressor mouse. Mice were maintained on a 12:12h light-dark cycle, with lights on at 7 a.m., and housed 5 per cage until the social defeat experience at which point onward they were single-housed. This housing included a plexiglass divider between the experimental mouse and its aggressor for continued visual stress stimulation. Twenty-four hours following the final social defeat, mice were subjected to a two-stage social interaction test, the results of which determined the grouping of the mice into either stress-susceptible or stress-resilient mice, the latter defined as spending more time in an “interaction zone” of an enclosure when it contained a novel CD1 mouse than when it was empty. Subsequently, the susceptible mice were divided into thirds and administered one of three treatments: either imipramine (20 mg/kg), ketamine (10 mg/kg), or saline. Imipramine and saline treatments were administered via i.p. injection once daily for fourteen days. Ketamine, however, was administered acutely due to prior evidence of effective treatment. Thus, the susceptible mice in the ketamine treatment group received saline i.p. injections for the first 13 days and one ketamine injection on the fourteenth day. Resilient and control mice also received saline treatments. Another social interaction test followed twenty-four hours after the final treatment to distinguish “responders” and “nonresponders” to their respective treatments. Responders were defined as subjects that spent more time interacting with the novel mouse after treatment and showed an increase of > 20 seconds in interaction time compared to the first SI test. Non-responders were defined as having spent less time interacting with the target or increased less than 10 seconds of interaction time. The subjects were killed two days thereafter in order to profile resting-state expression without the interference of effects from the behavioral testing.
